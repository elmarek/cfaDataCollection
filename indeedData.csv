We are seeking to find techs that possess Windows-based Domain and Networking skills.THIS INTERNSHIP/APPRENTICESHIP: This opportunity is aimed at an Entry-Level, tech-savvy individual that wants to get their foot in the door of a well-established small IT firm. UTS is a great place to apply your existing skills, learn and gain experience working with business networks, Active Directory, visualization, security, firewalling, VLAN\'s, VPN\'s, Group Policies, and end user support are what we work with all day. We are a full-spectrum IT firm for our clients handling virtually all issues with anything that has a power button. We are also small enough where jobs are not compartmentalized to a degree where the junior techs never get exposure to server-level technologies. We are all about internal cross-training our staff to help them grow in their aptitude and prefer to promote from within. This position can and will advance as fast as the employee demonstrates the necessary skills.WHAT WE DO: We build, manage and support small-ish (ranging from 5-250 node) windows domain-based networks for local small business clients; many of whom are in the medical/dental industry. Building PCs, taking client calls, doing remote tech support, running out to the client\'s location when necessary, troubleshooting hardware, networking and software issues are the routine.JOB DUTIES: - Answer client phone calls and email.- Occasional (we do about 80% of our work from within our Burien office) travel to customer location to perform on-site work.- Document work in our Helpdesk system.- Assemble PCs.- Provide remote and on-site business client support - user training, problem-solving and workarounds.- Installations & deployments of PCs, cabling and network gear.- Assist co-workers on larger projects.- Working with, engaging and coordinating 3rd party vendors (telecom companies, software vendors, etc.)- Helping out with other small business tasks like keeping the office tidy, picking up office supplies, etc.- Maintain a positive demeanor throughout.NON-TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: - Higher preference given to applicants that reside within a 10mi/15min distance of our Burien office.- Good at working with customer face-to-face and phone in a positive and friendly manner.- Professional appearance.- Some onsite travel - you must own a presentable vehicle.- You must be completely smoke-free.

The owner is a tech (not a sales guy or accountant) who came up through the ranks, and knows first hand what technical work is all about. The company is well-organized with procedures, knowledge base and an awesome in-house helpdesk system. We foster mentorship from within - there is no silo-ing of knowledge or information. Nearly all of our long-term senior techs, entered the company as interns. Additionally, we work exclusively with other businesses - we do not service home users.About 3 years ago we purposely moved our office from Seattle, to Burien. Burien provides for a better commute, free parking, much lower cost of living, great highway access and a vibrant downtown with many lunch or after-work happy hour options.The biggest benefit is a good work environment. In a small and rapidly growing company you have the opportunity to do and learn a wide variety of tasks, learn many different systems, configurations and work on a very diverse set of problems. There is also opportunity to grow -- there are not 8 levels of management between you and your wonderful ideas on how to do things better, or how you could be better utilized within the firm.You will be provided with a desk, a chair and office computer.

Our research often involves innovative based on combining these areas, like the Tableau product itself.\nFor the upcoming year, our research priorities are:\n* DATA MODELING AND MANAGEMENT. Cleaning, curating and shaping data is even harder (and more technical) than visualizing it. How can we help people get the right data quickly and easily?\n* MOBILE ANALYTICS. Our goal is Tableau everywhere, but there s a lot to learn about how people want to use data away from their desks. Includes both mobile and AR.\n* INSIGHT VALIDATION. The goal of analytics is insight into data how can we help people be sure the insights they see are real? How can we alert them to potential problems without overwhelming them?\n* AUTOMATION. Robust, reliable automatic methods can provide a power-boost to people performing the complex task of analytics. But people should be able to question and explore the results. What is the right balance for our users? While these are our priorities, they are not exclusive. A research internship is based on a mutually formulated project that furthers both a graduate student s research career and supports a research topic that is being explored by a member of Tableau Research. Candidates should explore our website (research.tableau.com) to find potential intern hosts. A research internship is a great way for students to learn more about industrial research, which has both academic publishing goals and the opportunity to impact our products. While many projects result in publications, others may produce only novel prototypes for exploration and inspiration. Research internships are typically three months long and most commonly occur in the summer, but we are flexible.\nWHAT YOU LL BE DOING\n* Work closely with a member of Tableau research, including regular meetings and feedback. * Present your project proposal and final results at the weekly Tableau Research Workshop.\n* Create and document a body of work (code, studies, and writings), which may lead to a published paper.\nWHO YOU ARE\n* EDUCATED.

They will work on understanding intrinsic oscillatory dynamics in recurrent neural networks.\nArtificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and biological neural circuits both perform computations in a distributed manner across local processing units with recurrent connections. These shared computational properties make RNNs a useful theoretical framework for modeling biological systems. RNNs are often trained to perform functions associated with a target brain region or neural circuit. However, unlike biological neurons, the processing units of RNNs lack intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. Therefore, while the biological and artificial systems may perform the same task, they make use of different internal computational mechanisms, making the dynamics of the trained RNN differ significantly from those of a biological network. Such artificial networks necessarily have limited utility for theoretical investigation of dynamical aspects of brain function that depend on time-dependent neuronal states and communication across biological circuits facilitated by synchronous oscillatory activity. To address this limitation, the student will develop an enhanced artificial neuron with intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. Using Python and the PyTorch machine learning platform, they will build a network of such processing units, facilitating exploration of the role of different cell types with different intrinsic properties on network dynamics and the emergence of oscillatory rhythms.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.\nThe MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.\nWe are seeking a summer intern to join the Modeling and Theory department for the summer of 2021. They will work on applying the novel denoising algorithm called DeepInterpolation to EEG data.\nIn the last year, we have demonstrated the application of the DeepInterpolation algorithm to two-photon imaging, electrophysiological neuropixels data as well as fMRI recordings (Lecoq et al, 2020, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341602v2). In all cases, this novel methodology greatly increased the SNR of individual experiments uncovering hidden neuronal dynamics. Our method does not need ground truth and therefore is applicable to a large collection of methodology in System Neurosciences.\nElectroencephalography recordings are heavily impacted by various sources of noise due to low signal to noise ratio as native electrical field signal are inherently weak and local in brain tissue (A Puce, MS H\xc3\xa4m\xc3\xa4l\xc3\xa4inen - Brain sciences, 2017). By training custom denoising filters adapted to each neuronal recording, we hope to improve the localization of brain areas responsible for generating part of the EEG signal (CM Michel, D Brunet - Frontiers in neurology, 2019).\nThe project goal is to use our machine learning OpenSource library (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation) and adapt its code to EEG datasets available on openneuro.org (https://openneuro.org/search/eeg). Then we hope to quantify the reconstruction quality of EEG signals. If this denoising shows good generalization performance in reconstruction loss, we will compare results obtained with DeepInterpolation with existing data processing pipeline (CM Michel, D Brunet - Frontiers in neurology, 2019).\nThe Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.\nThe mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling, and theory.\nWe are seeking a summer intern to join the Neuroanatomy department for the summer of 2021. They will work on Investigating morphological heterogeneity of interneurons across the mouse brain.\nOur Patch-seq pipeline has generated Morphologic, Electrophysiologic, and Transcriptomic (MET) data from multiple cortical regions beyond our primary area of interest, the visual cortex. These data have yet to be analyzed. Similarly, we have unanalyzed whole-brain fMOST image data with interneurons robustly labeled across multiple brain regions. The aim of the current project is to generate, analyze and compare interneuron morphologies from different cortical (and potentially subcortical) brain regions and across image datasets. As a means of rapidly acquiring interneuron reconstructions, the intern will leverage the existing IVSCC automated reconstruction pipeline and early data from machine learning-based autotracing of fMOST data, as well as an existing ""fragment tracer"" developed for excitatory neurons labeled in the fMOST data sets. The goal of this analysis is to identify general principles of cross-areal interneuron morphological heterogeneity and, where possible, establish the relationship with transcriptomically defined cell types. A core part of this project will be to perform evaluation and analysis of automated reconstructions from slice and whole-brain data, to perform neuron reconstructions using Vaa3d, and to extract and analyze morphological data to contribute to cell type classification.\nThe Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.\nEducational Objectives\nLearn single cell and whole-brain neuroanatomy\nUnderstand how to generate a morphologic feature set that can be used in cell-type classification\nPerform morphological analyses related to cell types classification\nGain familiarity with software packages used to handle, modify and analyze 3D morphological reconstructions\n\nApplicant Requirements\nCurrently enrolled in an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program\n2021 graduates of an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program will be considered\nMust be able to start on either June 7th or June 21st, 2021, and commit to the full 10 week internship time period.\nMust be eligible to work in the U.S. for the program duration\nMust be 18 years of age or older\n\nPhysical Demands\nFine motor movements in fingers/hands to operate computers and other office equipment; lab equipment\n\nNote: Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the expected functions.

The goal of analytics is insight into data how can we help people be sure the insights they see are real? How can we alert them to potential problems without overwhelming them?\n* AUTOMATION. Robust, reliable automatic methods can provide a power-boost to people performing the complex task of analytics. But people should be able to question and explore the results.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.\nThe MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.\nWe are seeking a summer intern to join the Modeling & Theory department for the summer of 2021. They will work on exploring the visual response properties of an uncommon subset of mouse cortical neurons.\nThe Allen Institute has generated large surveys of the activity of many types of neurons throughout the visual system. One of the very interesting kinds of responses we have observed is a small fraction of neurons in visual cortex (1-5%) that are suppressed by a particular kind of visual stimulus (gratings) that typically increase the activity of most other neurons. This project would entail analyzing the responses of these peculiar neurons to other types of visual stimuli in order to better understand their role in processing visual information. The data already exist as a part of the Allen Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Visual Coding Brain Observatory, and this project would involve learning to access, explore, and analyze these data. Therefore, the focus of the intern will be to implement analyses in Python to quantify and characterize the activity of the neurons, test the statistical robustness of their findings, and plot results for interpretation. The neurons that exhibit activity suppression are not confined to a single brain area or neuron type, so there is plenty of room to explore the many possible differences between activity-suppressed and not activity-suppressed neurons as well as differences among activity-suppressed neurons.\nThe Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.\nEducational Objectives\nGain familiarity with Brain Observatory Visual Coding datasets and software tools for exploring the data\nLearn to interpret neuron responses using quantitative metrics (e.g., mean, variance, sparseness, selectivity) and make new metrics to assess specific attributes of the activity of neurons\nLearn to make comparisons of neuron activity across neuron types or stimulus types that lead to a better understanding of how brain circuits function\nLearn how to make plots and figures that succinctly illustrate what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from the analysis\nLearn to design statistical tests to quantify the robustness of your findings\n\nApplicant Requirements\nCurrently enrolled in an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program\n2021 graduates of an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program will be considered\nMust be able to start on either June 7th or June 21st, 2021, and commit to the full 10 week internship time period\nMust be eligible to work in the U.S. for the program duration\nMust be 18 years of age or older\n\nPhysical Demands\nFine motor movements in fingers/hands to operate computers and other office equipment\n\nNote: Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the expected functions. This description reflects management\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of the physical demands of this role; it does not proscribe or restrict the tasks that may be assigned.\nPosition Type/Expected Hours of Work\nThis is a limited-term position for no more than 10 weeks\nThe expected work schedule is 35 \xe2\x80\x93 40 hours a week over this period\nThis role is currently able to work remotely due to COVID-19 and our focus on employee safety. We are a Washington State employer, and remote work must be performed in Washington State. We continue to evaluate the safest options for our employees.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.\nThe MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.\nWe are seeking a summer intern to join the Modeling & Theory department for the summer of 2021. They will work on exploring the visual response properties of an uncommon subset of mouse cortical neurons.\nThe Allen Institute has generated large surveys of the activity of many types of neurons throughout the visual system. One of the very interesting kinds of responses we have observed is a small fraction of neurons in visual cortex (1-5%) that are suppressed by a particular kind of visual stimulus (gratings) that typically increase the activity of most other neurons. This project would entail analyzing the responses of these peculiar neurons to other types of visual stimuli in order to better understand their role in processing visual information. The data already exist as a part of the Allen Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Visual Coding Brain Observatory, and this project would involve learning to access, explore, and analyze these data. Therefore, the focus of the intern will be to implement analyses in Python to quantify and characterize the activity of the neurons, test the statistical robustness of their findings, and plot results for interpretation.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.\nThe MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.\nWe are seeking a summer intern to join the Modeling & Theory department for the summer of 2021. They will work on Real-time prediction of LFP phase and high-frequency bursts using recurrent neural networks.\nNeuronal firing is entrained by specific features of the ongoing local field potential (LFP) oscillations, such as power and phase of certain frequency bands, as well as other events such as transient (<150ms) high frequency bursts. We are interested in exploring how the ongoing oscillations modulate evoked responses elicited by optical or electrical stimulation. Thus, the ability to estimate the phase (and other features) in the LFP signal just prior to the stimulus is an important aspect of response analysis. In two scenarios the phase estimation relies only on the signal prior to the stimulus onset: when the estimation is computed in real-time for closed-loop systems; and when the stimulus causes a large artifact (for e.g. optogenetic or electrical stimuli), rendering the signal close to or after the stimulus unusable. In these situations, the phase has been estimated using computational models in time and frequency domain, which both have certain limitations.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to work well for predicting temporally evolving systems. In this internship, the student will develop and train an RNN to forward-predict the phase of LFP and compare this technique to existing techniques for phase estimation. The RNN based method may be applicable more generally to any type of feature prediction in field potentials (such as high frequency bursts), unlike existing methods, which are designed specifically for predicting the phase. As a second part of the project, the student will test the generalization of the method to other LFP features besides the phase of the oscillatory signal. Finally, the trained RNN parameters could be encoding more general information about the state of the animal, such as arousal, level of consciousness etc. This could be an interesting exploratory extension of the project if time permits.\nThe Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.\nEducational Objectives\nImplement and train a recurrent neural network\nLearn and implement basic signal processing used to extrapolate features of oscillatory signals (filtering, spectrogram, coherence, Hilbert transforms etc.)\nLearn about measurements used to quantify evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) and Neuropixels LFP responses to stimulation (optogenetic and electrical) in mice\n\nApplicant Requirements\nCurrently enrolled in an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program\n2021 graduates of an accredited associate, undergraduate, or master\xe2\x80\x99s program will be considered\nMust be able to start on either June 7th or June 21st, 2021, and commit to the full 10-week internship time period\nMust be eligible to work in the U.S. for the program duration\nMust be 18 years of age or older\n\nPhysical Demands\nFine motor movements in fingers/hands to operate computers and other office equipment; lab equipment\n\nNote: Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the expected functions.

This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.\n\nSummit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 15 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.\n\nWe need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!\n\nSummit\'s Expeditions Program:\nThe areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Visual Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.\nIn particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:\nHealth & Wellness\nThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher\'s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.\nThe role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one\'s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about ""best fit"" colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.\nSummit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.\nCollaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.\nMentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on Habits of Success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.\nSee sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.\nAt Summit Public Schools, you are joining a community committed to excellence and continual growth. We prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders. If you are looking for the opportunity to drive transformative change in a diverse community of learners and contribute to reimagining what schools should be, we encourage you to apply.\nWhat You Need\nCommitment to uphold Summit\'s values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life\nTeaching Credential in California, Washington or another US state\nBachelor\'s Degree (a Master\'s Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)\nClear health and background check\nTeaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required\nWho You Are\nYou want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher\nYou thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues.

You\'re open to having hard conversations to support students.\nWhat You Get\n\nSummit offers competitive salaries and benefit options, including covering 75% of the health, dental, and vision plan costs. We fully cover life and disability insurance. We have a ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 11 paid holidays, 4 weeks of vacation during the year, and a summer break.

This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.\n\nSummit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 15 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.\n\nWe need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!\n\nSummit\'s Expeditions Program:\nThe areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Visual Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.\nIn particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:\nHealth & Wellness\nThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher\'s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.\nThe role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one\'s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about ""best fit"" colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.\nSummit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.\nCollaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.\nMentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on Habits of Success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.\nSee sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.\nAt Summit Public Schools, you are joining a community committed to excellence and continual growth. We prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders. If you are looking for the opportunity to drive transformative change in a diverse community of learners and contribute to reimagining what schools should be, we encourage you to apply.\nWhat You Need\nCommitment to uphold Summit\'s values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life\nTeaching Credential in California, Washington or another US state\nBachelor\'s Degree (a Master\'s Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)\nClear health and background check\nTeaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required\nWho You Are\nYou want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher\nYou thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.\nYou\'re excited to teach Summit\'s common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.\nYou care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life\nYou\'re eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.\nYou have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive\nYou are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you\'ll follow year to year. You\'re open to having hard conversations to support students.\nWhat You Get\n\nSummit offers competitive salaries and benefit options, including covering 75% of the health, dental, and vision plan costs. We fully cover life and disability insurance. We have a ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 11 paid holidays, 4 weeks of vacation during the year, and a summer break.

This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.\n\nSummit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 14 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.\n\nWe need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!\n\nSummit\'s Expeditions Program:\nThe areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Visual Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.\nIn particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:\nHealth & Wellness\nThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher\'s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.\nThe role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one\'s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about ""best fit"" colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.\nSummit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.\nCollaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.\nMentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on Habits of Success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.\nSee sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.\nAt Summit Public Schools, you are joining a community committed to excellence and continual growth. We prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders. If you are looking for the opportunity to drive transformative change in a diverse community of learners and contribute to reimagining what schools should be, we encourage you to apply.\nWhat You Need\nCommitment to uphold Summit\'s values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life\nTeaching Credential in California, Washington or another US state\nBachelor\'s Degree (a Master\'s Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)\nClear health and background check\nTeaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required\nWho You Are\nYou want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher\nYou thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.\nYou\'re excited to teach Summit\'s common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.\nYou care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life\nYou\'re eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.\nYou have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive\nYou are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you\'ll follow year to year. You\'re open to having hard conversations to support students.\nWhat You Get\n\nSummit offers competitive salaries and benefit options, including covering 75% of the health, dental, and vision plan costs. We fully cover life and disability insurance. We have a ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 11 paid holidays, 4 weeks of vacation during the year, and a summer break. We value our teachers\' Summit experience, offering stipends for teachers who have been with us for three or more years and helping teachers grow with us through designated time for paid professional development and regular coaching.\n\nSummit Public Schools does not discriminate in any programs or activities on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, color, national origin, age, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal and provides equal access to all programs.\n\nPeople from all diverse backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. Spanish language proficiency is a plus.\n\nWe don\'t just encourage diversity and inclusion\xe2\x80\x94we believe it\'s a requirement for us to be successful in our mission of helping all children succeed.

This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.\n\nSummit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 14 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.\n\nWe need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!\n\nSummit\'s Expeditions Program:\nThe areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Visual Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.\nIn particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:\nHealth & Wellness\nThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher\'s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.\nThe role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one\'s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about ""best fit"" colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.\nSummit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.\nCollaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.\nMentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on Habits of Success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.\nSee sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.\nAt Summit Public Schools, you are joining a community committed to excellence and continual growth. We prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders. If you are looking for the opportunity to drive transformative change in a diverse community of learners and contribute to reimagining what schools should be, we encourage you to apply.\nWhat You Need\nCommitment to uphold Summit\'s values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life\nTeaching Credential in California, Washington or another US state\nBachelor\'s Degree (a Master\'s Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)\nClear health and background check\nTeaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required\nWho You Are\nYou want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher\nYou thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.\nYou\'re excited to teach Summit\'s common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.\nYou care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life\nYou\'re eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.\nYou have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive\nYou are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you\'ll follow year to year. You\'re open to having hard conversations to support students.\nWhat You Get\n\nSummit offers competitive salaries and benefit options, including covering 75% of the health, dental, and vision plan costs. We fully cover life and disability insurance. We have a ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 11 paid holidays, 4 weeks of vacation during the year, and a summer break. We value our teachers\' Summit experience, offering stipends for teachers who have been with us for three or more years and helping teachers grow with us through designated time for paid professional development and regular coaching.\n\nSummit Public Schools does not discriminate in any programs or activities on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, color, national origin, age, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal and provides equal access to all programs.\n\nPeople from all diverse backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.

This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.\n\nSummit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 14 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.\n\nWe need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!\n\nSummit\'s Expeditions Program:\nThe areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Visual Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.\nIn particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:\nHealth & Wellness\nThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher\'s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.\nThe role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one\'s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about ""best fit"" colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.\nSummit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.\nSummit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.\nCollaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.\nMentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on Habits of Success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.\nSee sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.\nAt Summit Public Schools, you are joining a community committed to excellence and continual growth. We prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders. If you are looking for the opportunity to drive transformative change in a diverse community of learners and contribute to reimagining what schools should be, we encourage you to apply.\nWhat You Need\nCommitment to uphold Summit\'s values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life\nTeaching Credential in California, Washington or another US state\nBachelor\'s Degree (a Master\'s Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)\nClear health and background check\nTeaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required\nWho You Are\nYou want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher\nYou thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues.

You\'re open to having hard conversations to support students.\nWhat You Get\n\nSummit offers competitive salaries and benefit options, including covering 75% of the health, dental, and vision plan costs. We fully cover life and disability insurance. We have a ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 11 paid holidays, 4 weeks of vacation during the year, and a summer break. We value our teachers\' Summit experience, offering stipends for teachers who have been with us for three or more years and helping teachers grow with us through designated time for paid professional development and regular coaching.\n\nSummit Public Schools does not discriminate in any programs or activities on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, color, national origin, age, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal and provides equal access to all programs.\n\nPeople from all diverse backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. Spanish language proficiency is a plus.\n\nWe don\'t just encourage diversity and inclusion\xe2\x80\x94we believe it\'s a requirement for us to be successful in our mission of helping all children succeed.
